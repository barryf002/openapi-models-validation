    # Filters

    When querying collections, the provided query parameters

    are validated. Unknown query parameters are ignored.

    Providing invalid filter values should yield a validation error.


    # State

    A lot of resources are stateful, indicated by the presence of

    a `state` property, to support the

    inherently asynchronous nature of provisioning, deployment and

    on-boarding processes.


    The following table describes the meaning of each state:


    | State | Meaning |

    | ------ | ------ |

    | requested | Resource has been requested by the customer but not yet fully reserved
    (sub-resources required) |

    | allocated | All resources required for service are reserved |

    | testing | The resource is provisioned and is currently being tested |

    | production | The resource is active and can be used by the customer |

    | production_change_pending | The resource is active but the customer has requested
    a change that is awaiting completion |

    | decommission_requested | The resource is active but the customer has requested
    disconnection that is awaiting completion |

    | decommissioned | The resource has been de-provisioned and billing is terminated
    or scheduled for termination |

    | archived | The resource was "deleted/purged" and is not listed unless explicitly
    requested in the filter (i.e. `?state=archived`). |

    | error | The resource has experienced error during provisioning or after is has
    been activated |

    | cancelled | The request for a service was cancelled before provisioning was
    completed |

    | operator | Human intervention is needed |

    | scheduled | The service has been scheduled for provisioning |


    Please note, that not all implementers _HAVE_ to implement

    all the listed states.


    *Sidenote:* If the deleted operation is applied to an object in

    state `decommissioned` the object will move to state archived.


    # Sensitive Properties


    Some properties contain sensitive information and should be redacted when

    the resource is made available users outside the authorized scope.


    This is for example the case when an `Account` is flagged as `discoverable`,

    it becomes available to other API users. In this case only: `id`, `name`

    and `metro_area_network_presence` should be exposed.


    If a property is `required` and needs to be redacted, a zero value

    should be used. For strings this would be an empty string `""`,

    for numeric values `0` and booleans `false`.


    Shared resources with sensitive properties: `Account`, `NetworkService`
