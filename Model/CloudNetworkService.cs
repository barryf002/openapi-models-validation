/*
 * IX-API
 *
 *  This API allows to configure/change/delete Internet Exchange services.  # Filters When querying collections, the provided query parameters are validated. Unknown query parameters are ignored. Providing invalid filter values should yield a validation error.  # State A lot of resources are stateful, indicated by the presence of a `state` property, to support the inherently asynchronous nature of provisioning, deployment and on-boarding processes.  The following table describes the meaning of each state:  | State | Meaning | | - -- -- - | - -- -- - | | requested | Resource has been requested by the customer but not yet fully reserved (sub-resources required) | | allocated | All resources required for service are reserved | | testing | The resource is provisioned and is currently being tested | | production | The resource is active and can be used by the customer | | production_change_pending | The resource is active but the customer has requested a change that is awaiting completion | | decommission_requested | The resource is active but the customer has requested disconnection that is awaiting completion | | decommissioned | The resource has been de-provisioned and billing is terminated or scheduled for termination | | archived | The resource was \"deleted/purged\" and is not listed unless explicitly requested in the filter (i.e. `?state=archived`). | | error | The resource has experienced error during provisioning or after is has been activated | | cancelled | The request for a service was cancelled before provisioning was completed | | operator | Human intervention is needed | | scheduled | The service has been scheduled for provisioning |  Please note, that not all implementers _HAVE_ to implement all the listed states.  *Sidenote:* If the deleted operation is applied to an object in state `decommissioned` the object will move to state archived.  # Sensitive Properties  Some properties contain sensitive information and should be redacted when the resource is made available users outside the authorized scope.  This is for example the case when an `Account` is flagged as `discoverable`, it becomes available to other API users. In this case only: `id`, `name` and `metro_area_network_presence` should be exposed.  If a property is `required` and needs to be redacted, a zero value should be used. For strings this would be an empty string `\"\"`, for numeric values `0` and booleans `false`.  Shared resources with sensitive properties: `Account`, `NetworkService`
